This folder contains some sanity checks for the code in the repository. 

In particuar, ``dataset_creation.py`` implements dataset construction and determinism checks, together with a PML bug visualization.

The ``check_spatial_derivatives.py`` contains code that checks the values of numerical derivatives, 
which are used in some of the PINN models on spatial coordinates.
